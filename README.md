# bytehaven
 MMO RPG in nodejs

To start:

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

Once the sim is running, open public/index.html in your browser.

Edit the index.js to goof off with whatever you wanna do. I'm thinking there will be a game engine part of this, and a Bytehaven implementation. The engine part is in engine/ for now, and the Bytehaven specific is in lib/

Seriously. Just mess around with this.
