# bytehaven
 MMO RPG in nodejs

To start:
npm install
npm run watch
open -> public/index.html

Edit the index.js to goof off with whatever you wanna do. I'm thinking there will be a game engine part of this (calling it NovaEngine for the time being), and a Bytehaven implementation. The engine part is in lib for now

Seriously. Just mess around with this.
